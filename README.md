# E-Commerce App using React.js
Inside the Components folder, I created a 'Product' component, which I put inside of 'Products' since that is the only place it'll be used. (product is inside of products folder.)
Since for now I'm only using React for this project without a backend, I decided to put my products in an array as part of it's own component file.
